ompl_sandbox
============

Uncommented, very ad-hoc (not very reusable) code to boost OMPL development.

If any of these tools become really useful I would try to include them in the OMPL. However, that is not the objective. The objective of this repo is just to save pieces of code I use to debug OMPL when developing.

However, if you are really interested about anything let me know and I would help you as much as possible.
